          <h1>Hi!</h1>
          <p>I'm Andr√© Neubauer. For over 15 years I've developed software systems for different companies and contribute to open source projects. Even though I do not develop software professionally anymore, I'm still proud of wearing the clean-code bracelet.</p>

        <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-3 col-lg-3">


          <p>In the recent years I was primarily working as an engineering manager. Beside leadership aspects, professionalism in software development is very important to me. That's why, I am convinced that professional software development is an engineering activity.</p>

          <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.</p>

          <p>Last but not least, I'm a "conference tourist" and I like to share my experience and views. This is also a good place for one of my hobbies. I collect stickers of companies (of course only the cool ones) as you can see it at the top of this page.</p>
