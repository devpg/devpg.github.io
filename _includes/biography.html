        <h2>Hi, I'm André Neubauer!</h2>
        <p>For over 15 years I've been working on software systems for different companies and contributing to open source projects. Even though I do not develop software professionally anymore, I'm still proud of wearing the clean-code bracelet.</p>
        <p>In the recent years I was primarily working as an engineering manager and also as an executive on the business side. Beside leadership aspects, professionalism in software development is very important to me. That's why, I am convinced, among other things, that professional software development is an engineering activity.</p>

        <h2 class="visible-lg-block visible-md-block">&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>I'm a strong advocate on agile methods and lean principles. I have many years of experience with XP, Scrum and Kanban. I implemented those in several companies to become powerful organisations. I also have a deep understanding about organisational setup and culture forming.</p>
        <p>Last but not least, I'm a "conference tourist" and I like to share my experience and views. Some of my presentations you can find below. If you want to chat about any of these topics, feel free to contact me.</p>
