  I'm shaping tech environments for more than 15 years, bringing technology and business together. I've worked for SME up to large corporates on all levels, from software engineering to guiding and consulting of technical teams and transforming companies and their business on a tactical and strategic level. In recent years I was primarily working as a Chief Technology Officer.
  I've studied informatics and later business economics. Yet to say, my focus is still technology. I have a strong passion for technical topics, especially architecture and technology trends.
  Next to it, I'm an advocate on modern leadership with a strong focus on product development, software engineering, and data intelligence. I have extensive experience with lean/ agile methodologies and transformation of enterprises. Company culture is crucial to me.
