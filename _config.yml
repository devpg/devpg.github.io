  # Hi! I'm Andr√©.

  I've been shaping tech environments for more than 15 years, bringing technology and business together. During that time, I've worked for SMEs up to big corporations. I have profound experience in Software Engineering and even more experience on the leadership side. In this role, I'm building and guiding organizations and transforming companies and their business on a tactical and strategic level. In recent years I was primarily working as a Chief Technology Officer.
  
  I've studied informatics and, later on, business economics. Yet to say, my focus is still on technology. I have a strong passion for technical topics, especially technology trends and their usage to drive innovation. Besides that, I've led various projects, from technical migrations to post-acquisition integrations. Finally, I'm an advocate of modern leadership and progressive organizational design. I have extensive experience in transforming organizations into sustainable technology powerhouses.

  I like to give back and share my experience at conference talks and consult companies in mastering their challenges.
