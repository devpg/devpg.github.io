Another year, another RIP of QA ...

Yes, QA changed quite a lot during the last decade - btw, same as software engineering!

Often, there is this saying that QA should be done by Software Engineers. What's actually meant by this is a high degree of test automation. And I absolutely agree to this. However, there are two issues ...

1. Environments with high degree of test automation in all aspects rarely exists. This means, manual QA is still required.
2. Even if you are working in such an environment - lucky you -, you will realise that the mindset of QA Engineer and Software Engineer are very different. Coming up with good test cases is a dedicated skill.

So what?

In my humble opinion QA will stay. It's just the approach which changes based on your context.
