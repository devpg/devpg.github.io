        <h2>Hi, I'm Andr√© Neubauer!</h2>
        <p>For over 15 years I've been working on software systems for different companies and contributing to open source projects.</p>
        <p>Over the years my focus switched from operational software engineering to guiding and consulting of technical teams and transforming companies and their business on a tactical and strategic level. However, I still have a strong passion for technical topics and all the rising technology trends.</p>
        <p>In the recent years I was primarily working as an chief technology officer and also as an executive on the business side. Beside leadership aspects, professionalism in software engineering is very important to me. That's why, I am convinced, among other things, that professional software development requires an engineering skills and therefore is an engineering discipline.</p>

        <p>I'm a strong advocate on agile methods and lean principles. I have many years of experience with XP, Scrum and Kanban. I implemented those in several companies to become powerful organisations. I also have a deep understanding about organisational setup and culture forming.</p>
        <p>Last but not least, I'm a "conference tourist" and I like to share my experience and views. Some of my presentations you can find below. If you want to chat about any of these topics, feel free to contact me.</p>
