# Hi! I'm André Neubauer.

For close to 20 years, I have seamlessly blended technology and business, defining the technical landscapes from nimble startups to established corporations. My expertise ranges from software engineering - the beginning of my career - to the broader strokes of technical leadership, which is my focus for the last decade. As a Chief Technology Officer, I’ve charted the course for organizations, steering transformational initiatives at both tactical and strategic tiers.

My academic pursuits in informatics and later on business economics only sharpened my intrinsic passion for technology for building successful businesses. I am particularly keen on technology trends and their potential to drive innovation. Over the years, I've successfully helmed diverse projects, spanning from new products over technical migrations to complex post-acquisition integrations.

I’m a staunch proponent of modern leadership and progressive organizational design. I have extensive experience in transforming organizations into sustainable technology powerhouses.

Next to being Chief Technology Officer at Trusted Shops - Europe's leading trust brand - I also use my wealth of experience to actively support companies, both as a tech advisor and a business angel, in conquering their technological hurdles. 

Let's connect!
