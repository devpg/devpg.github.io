# Hi! I'm Andr√© Neubauer.

For nearly two decades, I've shaped Tech & Product and it's interface to the business in varied settings, from startups to major corporations. My journey began in software engineering and evolved into technical leadership, a role I've passionately undertaken for the past 15 years. 

As CTO, I've spearheaded transformative projects and strategies, backed by an academic foundation in informatics and business economics. Always at the forefront of modern leadership practices, I've transformed companies into tech powerhouses. Beyond my role as CTO, I actively mentor tech leaders and consult businesses, guiding them through their tech challenges.

## I'm also writing [The Tech Advisor](https://devpg.substack.com). 
In this newsletter I share insights and personal experiences within the realms of technology and leadership. Additionally, it serves as a respository for some nuggets I came across in my learning journey and maybe are valuable for other technical leaders as well.
