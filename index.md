# Hi! I'm Andr√© Neubauer.

For nearly two decades, I've shaped the tech-business interface in varied settings, from startups to major corporations. My journey began in software engineering and evolved into technical leadership, a role I've passionately undertaken for the past 15 years. 

As CTO, I've spearheaded transformative projects and strategies, backed by an academic foundation in informatics and business economics. Always at the forefront of modern leadership practices, I've transformed entities into tech powerhouses. Beyond my role as CTO, I actively mentor and invest in businesses, guiding them through tech challenges. 

Let's connect!
